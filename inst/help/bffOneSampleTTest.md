Bayes Factor Functions 
===

The module employs Bayes factor functions (BFFs; Johnson, Pramanik and Shudde, 2023) to streamline hypothesis testing by directly comparing competing hypotheses using standardized effect sizes. This approach simplifies the calculation of Bayes factors from common test statistics, provides clear and intuitive summaries of experimental results without relying on arbitrary significance thresholds.
